    description: "The Peugeot 407 was introduced as a replacement for the successful 406, featuring dramatically more distinctive styling with a prominent front overhang, large grille opening, and sleek profile. Available in three body styles: a four-door sedan, a five-door station wagon (SW), and the elegant two-door coupe designed by Pininfarina. Built on PSA's Platform 3, it featured double-wishbone front suspension and a multi-link rear setup providing improved handling and ride comfort. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included gasoline engines ranging from 1.8L to 3.0L V6, and diesel options from 1.6L to 3.0L V6 HDi, paired with manual, automated manual (2.0 HDi only), or conventional automatic transmissions. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with a prominent center console, available features including dual-zone climate control, high-end JBL audio, and satellite navigation system with a pop-up screen. Safety was emphasized with up to nine airbags, electronic stability control, and available lane departure warning systemâ€”advanced for its time. A significant refresh in 2008 brought subtle styling updates, improved interior materials, and enhanced efficiency across the engine range. The 407 represented a more dynamic, design-focused approach compared to its predecessor, though its bold styling proved somewhat polarizing. Over its production run, approximately 900,000 units were sold, making it less commercially successful than the 406 it replaced, but it remained an important model in Peugeot's lineup until succeeded by the 508 in 2011."
